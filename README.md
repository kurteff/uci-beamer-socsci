Unofficial Beamer Template for UCI School of Social Sciences

The starting point for this template was the [Unofficial UCI Engineering Beamer Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/unofficial-uci-engineering-beamer-template/qvqfvsctgkgn). However, I'm in the Cognitive Sciences department so I needed one for my school. I also drew inspiration from [sajjadt's unofficial UCI template](https://github.com/sajjadt/uci-beamer).
